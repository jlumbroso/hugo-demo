# Hugo Quick Walkthrough

Done in Towne 217 on Feb 20.

## To run locally:

You need to have `git` and Hugo installed, and then you can clone the repo and launch a local copy of the website:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jlumbroso/hugo-demo
cd hugo-demo
cd my-demo-site
hugo server
```

This showcases how to use a simple `index.html` and `_default/single.html` templates to create a simple website with Hugo, and illustrate how Go templating works.
